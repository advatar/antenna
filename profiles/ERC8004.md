# ERC-8004 Usage Notes (Antenna profile)

Primary agents are represented as ERC-8004 identities.

## Agent identifier
- `agentRegistry = eip155:<chainId>:<identityRegistryAddress>`
- `agentId = <tokenId>`

## Registration file
The ERC-8004 registration file SHOULD include:
- a service named `A2A` pointing to an Agent Card endpoint
- a service named `ENS` with the agent's ENS handle
- a service named `MB-P2P` pointing to a Antenna P2P contact card

See `examples/erc8004.registration-file.alice.json`.

## Sepolia curated registries
This repo ships a convenience config file in `networks/sepolia.json`.
Verify addresses against the official ERC-8004 deployment source when you integrate.
